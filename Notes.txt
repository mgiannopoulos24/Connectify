Make admin pages responsive and add search functionality.

Write tests for both frontend and backend.

Release Workflow Documentation
=================================
# GitHub Actions workflow to create a new release.
#
# This workflow is triggered when a new tag is pushed to the repository.
# It then builds the project, creates a GitHub release, and uploads the
# build artifacts to that release.
#
# To use this workflow:
# 1. Create a file named `release.yml` in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
# 2. Customize the `build-project` job with your project's build commands.
# 3. Commit and push this file to your repository.
# 4. To trigger the workflow, create and push a new tag:
#    git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
#    git push origin v1.0.0
