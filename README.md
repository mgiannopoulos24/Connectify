# Connectify

## Description
This is the full project for Connectify, a LinkedIn clone application, which includes both the frontend (React) and the backend (Flask/Django). The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for managing users, articles, job postings, and messages, while the frontend is used for data presentation and user interaction.

## Technologies
### Backend
- Python
- Flask or Django
- MySQL or SQLite
- Flask-JWT-Extended or Django Rest Framework (DRF)

### Frontend
- React
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- React Router (for navigation)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL 5.7+ or SQLite

## Installation
### Backend
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/connectify.git
    cd connectify/backend
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set up the database (for MySQL):
    - Create a database:
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE connectify;
      ```
    - Update the `config.py` file with the database connection details:
      ```python
      SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/connectify'
      ```

5. Run the migrations to create the database tables:
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade  # For Flask-Migrate
    python manage.py migrate  # For Django
    ```

6. Start the application:
    ```bash
    flask run  # For Flask
    python manage.py runserver  # For Django
    ```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Development Environment
- Use `venv` to isolate the backend environment.
- Use a `.env` file to store environment variables for the backend.
- Use `create-react-app` to initialize the React project.

## Usage
### Backend
#### User Registration
- Endpoint: `POST /register`
- Request Body:
```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  }
```
#### User Login
- Endpoint: `POST /login`
- Request Body:
```json
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "password": "password123"
    }
```
### Frontend
- The React application will communicate with the backend through the above endpoints using the Axios library.
- You can add instructions for specific pages or features of the frontend here.
