# Connectify

## Description
This is the full project for Connectify, a LinkedIn clone application, which includes both the frontend (React) and the backend (Flask/Django). The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for managing users, articles, job postings, and messages, while the frontend is used for data presentation and user interaction.

## Technologies
### Backend
- Elixir (Phoenix Framework)
- PostgreSQL (for database)

### Frontend
- React
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- React Router (for navigation)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Install dependencies using `mix deps.get`.
3. Set up the database with `mix ecto.setup`.
4. Start the server with `mix phx.server`.
